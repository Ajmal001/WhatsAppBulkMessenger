# WhatsApp Bulk Messager :mega:

## :dart: What it does 
This tool makes adding multiple people to a whatsapp group much easier. 

To prevent spam, WhatsApp desn't allow users to add anyone who is not there in their contact list to a group. So one has to either send them the group link over email etc., which might not be seen by them immediately. 

This tool allows you to directly send the link to a list of people who can instantly join your group. :tada:
