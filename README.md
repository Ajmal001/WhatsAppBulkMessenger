# WhatsApp Bulk Messager :mega:

## What it does :shipit:
This tool solves the problem of adding multiple people to a WhatsApp group. :confetti_ball:

To prevent spam, WhatsApp desn't allow users to add anyone who is not there in their contact list to a group. So one has to either send them the group link over email etc., which might not be seen by them immediately. 

This tool allows you to directly send the link to a list of people who can instantly join your group. :tada:
